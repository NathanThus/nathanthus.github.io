# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I’m a professional Embedded Systems and Game Developer, skilled in C, C++, and C#. My expertise extends to Arduino, ESP32, and STM for Embedded Systems, and Unity for Game Development.

Beyond my career, I’m an enthusiast of vinyl, metal, and video games. In my free time, I stay busy with a variety of projects, ranging from hands-on crafts to software and game development.
